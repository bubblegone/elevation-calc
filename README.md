# Elevator

Simple tool to get color values for elevated elements based on page background color. This should be used for **dark theme only** as on light theme elevation is done through shadows and not through brightening elevated elements background. This tool is based on [Material UI 2 dark theme guide](https://m2.material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html)
